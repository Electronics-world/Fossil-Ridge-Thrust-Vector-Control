# Fossil Ridge Thrust Vector Control
Open-Source Model Rocket Thrust Vector Control project. 
Code, CAD files, and instructions are all free to download and view.

# Best part about our project?

You can use our code without having to build our exact rocket!
The TVC code is in Arduino, but you can use computers like the Teensy as well.
We have created a wiki page (here on Github! look to the right of the quicklinks bar at the top) to aid you in formatting the code so it works with your specific project. It explains in really simple terms some concepts - such as Analytical Geometry - which are crucial to the project, but which are normally hard to understand.

If you don't want to make your own rocket, we also have our CAD files for our rocket uploaded here. But again, you can use our code without our rocket design!

Created by Quentin Perez-Wahl, Dmitri Gorely, Jackson Dryg, and Jack Willis.
